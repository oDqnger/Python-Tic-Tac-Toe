# Python Tic Tac Toe

If you're wondering why there are 250+ lines in a mini text based tic tac toe project made from python, its because I added way too many features to the game (like settings, accounts etc). If you're new to python or programming in general, this
is a great project to start with. You don't have to include all the extra stuff I addded because I did it as a challenge.

# How to play
To play, make sure you have python 3+ installed, then you need to download the main.py file and place it anywhere in your computer. Then, go to your cmd (terminal for mac or linux users) and then navigate to the folder path using "cd [insert folder name here, dont include the brackets]. Once you are in the folder where the main.py file is stored, run the py file by typing, "python main.py."

i spent way too much time on this.
